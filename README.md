# 2D Lidar odometry in the Real-World 

This project implements Iterative closest point algorithm to register consecutive scans taken from 2D-Lidar scanner mounted on a robotic vehicle

## Details
Multiple scans are taken using a 2D- Lidar scanner. First two scans are shown in image below. The task is to register all the scans and generate a 2D map of environment.

The final registered scans look as shown in image below.
